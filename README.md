# Prism

A lightweight 3D renderer for SwiftUI.

- Works with any SwiftUI `View`.
- Fully interactive and animatable.
- Compatible with all SwiftUI modifiers.
- No positioning side effects, unlike GeometryReader.
- 100% SwiftUI — no SceneKit, SpriteKit, etc.
- Powered by perspective transforms, so it's fast.
- Supports sizing, extrusion, levitation, and more.
- Compose complex scenes with a familiar API.

## Installation

Requires iOS 13+ or macOS Catalina and up. Prism can be installed through the [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).

```

## Usage

Prism is designed to be easy to use. First, define a `PrismConfiguration` for customization. Then add a `PrismCanvas`, which can contain as many `PrismView`s as you'd like.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var configuration = PrismConfiguration(
        tilt: 0.5, /// A value from 0 to 1, representing the perspective.
        size: CGSize(width: 200, height: 200), /// How big the prism is.
        extrusion: 100, /// The z height.
        levitation: 20, /// How far the prism is from the ground.
        shadowColor: Color.black, /// A dynamic shadow that's rendered underneath the prism.
        shadowOpacity: 0.25 /// The strength of the shadow.
    )

    var body: some View {
        PrismCanvas(tilt: configuration.tilt) {
            PrismView(configuration: configuration) {
                Color.blue
            } left: {
                Color.red
            } right: {
                Color.green
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Apps Using Prism

[**SwiftUICraft**](https://github.com/aheze/SwiftUICraft) is Minecraft but made with Prism. You can move, add blocks, add water, switch worlds, and more. Thanks to Prism it's 100% SwiftUI with literally nothing else!
